CHANGES
=======

1.10.1
------

* Add AWS S3 Tables (Iceberg) support with automatic schema evolution
  - Implement S3 Tables detection via endpoint_type='s3_tables' configuration
  - Add DROP + CREATE pattern for table materialization (no CREATE OR REPLACE support)
  - Add DELETE + INSERT pattern for incremental models (no MERGE support)
  - Integrate PyIceberg for automatic schema evolution via dbt.adapters.duckdb.iceberg_utils
  - Schema evolution: automatically add new columns, preserve removed columns with NULL values
  - Support iceberg_properties configuration using set_iceberg_table_properties() function (DuckDB 1.4.2+)
  - Support partition_by configuration for Iceberg table partitioning using PyIceberg (single or multiple partition keys with transforms: identity, year, month, day, hour, bucket, truncate)
  - Support watermark_column for deduplication in incremental models
  - Use DESCRIBE instead of information_schema for Iceberg metadata queries
  - Add transaction commits after DROP and schema evolution for metadata refresh
  - Add is_s3_tables_catalog(), get_s3_tables_catalog_config(), and evolve_s3_tables_schema() methods to adapter
* Fix DuckDB Iceberg limitations documentation - clarify these are DuckDB's Iceberg implementation limitations, not S3 Tables specific
* Add comprehensive AWS S3 Tables documentation to README with configuration examples, authentication details, and example project structure
* Add s3tables extra with all required dependencies: pyiceberg>=0.5.0, pyarrow>=10.0.0, boto3>=1.26.0 (install with: pip install dbt-duckdb[s3tables])
