Something what i don't understand?

- For example we want to push something with a sql plugin to a database. Why we first write it down to disk and then read in memory with pandas and then push it further?    



Future:

- If we make an external materialization we want that upstream models can refer to it? How to do it we have to register an df and create an view to it?
